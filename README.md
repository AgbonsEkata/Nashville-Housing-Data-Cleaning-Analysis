# Nashville-Housing-Data-Cleaning-Analysis

In this SQL project, I've cleaned the Nashville housing data table for better analysis using intermediate to advanced SQL queries. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data). With this dataset, I Practiced a wide range of SQL queries including Aggregate Functions, Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, and Views to clean this dataset.

In this project, some of the chllenges we had to overcome, and the data cleaning queries used include;

* Filling Null entries

* Self Joins

* Splitting into multiple columns using Substring(), Position(), Length(), Split_Part() and Replace()

* Creating and Updating new tables

* Replacing values ("Y to Yes", "N to No") using CASE Statements

* Removing duplicates through Window Functions(ROW_NUMBER()), CTE'S AND VIEWS
